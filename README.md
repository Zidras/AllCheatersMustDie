**All Cheaters Must Die** is an addon created to serve as a defense against Denial-of-Service attacks by auto-ignoring the perpetrator before server disconnects.
It also stores the information regarding the perpetrator in the SavedVariables folder, if needed.

## How to use
Only needs to be enabled in the AddOns list. Once you login, the addon will work automatically in the background.

## Support
If you would like to show your appreciation for my work (**which is by no means required**), you can donate in two ways:
- [**Streamelements**](https://streamelements.com/the_zidras/tip): your Twitch name will show on my stream at the time of the donation, and in the widget as the latest donation!
- [**PayPal**](https://paypal.me/zidras).

## How to install and update the addon
1. Download the addon from the **main** repository (https://github.com/Zidras/AllCheatersMustDie/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Inside the zip file, open AllCheatersMustDie-main and copy (Ctrl+C) **AllCheatersMustDie** folder over to your addons folder (Interface/Addons).
